                        I have played computer games since I was a little boy. Some of my favorites have been the Diablo series for computer and the Pokemon gameboy games. But any good strategy or RPG game could keep me hooked for hours. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I am more into programming games than playing them. And basic HTML, CSS, and javascript have been excellent tools for the job. Quickly surpassing the level of 'guess the number game', I worked my way through making a snake game and finally made pretty sweet, if not a little incomplete and messily coded <a href="apps/liberatus/index.html" target="_blank">RPG dungeon crawler game</a>, which took me about a month's time to make, and taught me many lessons by way of trial and error and google searching. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But let's get one thing straight - the games I have built up to now are warm-ups, and I am aiming for professional quality. After all, it has been but a year since I have started coding. 
                    </p>
                    <figure class="article-img">
                        <img src="imgs/minesweeper-ss.jpg" alt="Minesweeper is a classic game.">
                        <figcaption>Minesweeper is a classic game.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The games I have built up to now have not been using the HTML5 element canvas, a useful tool when making high-quality, cross-platform games. Instead, they are based on a grid made of div elements, an array of arrays to hold data on each grid square, and then just plain old css and javascript. And I feel like this method has worked pretty well so far, and could surely be taken farther.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I am steadily working on learning the ins and outs of canvas, currently from <a href="http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/toc.html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. It is a lot of fun. So far, I have made a few different graphs, like the line graph shown below.
                    </p>
                    <figure class="article-img">
                        <img src="imgs/line-graph.png" alt="An interactive graph made using canvas.">
                        <figcaption>An interactive graph made using canvas.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        It is pretty great to be able to make interactive graphs and charts like this, and could be useful for making utility apps that report back on information (like my <a href="apps/market-manager/index.html" target="_blank">market manager app</a>). But the real goal here is of course to make some high quality games. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So between the 10 hours of farming each day, I get a moment here and there to do a little programming. Soon I will be able to dedicate myself fully to coding, and then it won't be long before I can really up my skills and get this business rolling!

                        Hi, I'm JP, and today, I am starting a small online business. A bit over a year ago, I was living in San Francisco, California, a center for software development and small start-up businesses. The bug must have rubbed off on me, because I started teaching myself how to code web sites and apps, and haven't stopped since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So now I am creating codeWillow, the business front for my work in software development. The main focus of codeWillow is on (a), html5 games using canvas, and (b) utility applications, especially with the needs of ethically-minded and good-hearted small organic farmers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I am living on just such a farm in Ontario, Canada, where I have been for the whole 2016 season. When I finish the season here, I will move to the city and dedicate myself full-time to my coding and the thus-far unofficial and independently run codeWillow online business. So feel free to have a look around. Take a look at some of the <a href="apps.html">apps I have created so far</a>. And stay tuned, as there is <em>much</em> more to come in the near future.
